## 🚀 About The Game

**Math Wars** is not just another math game - it's an epic battle arena where your mathematical skills are put to the ultimate test! Born from frustration with boring educational apps, we created a game that transforms math practice into an intense, addictive survival experience.

### 🎯 Why Math Wars Stands Out?

- **🔥 Truly Endless**: Infinite levels that scale from basic arithmetic to Harvard-level puzzles
- **😂 Roasting System**: Get humorously mocked for wrong answers - fueling your determination to improve
- **💫 Professional Grade**: Cyberpunk-inspired UI that rivals premium mobile games
- **🎮 Addictive Loop**: Coin system, power-ups, and achievements that keep you engaged for hours
- **📱 Zero Compromises**: Fully responsive design that works flawlessly on all devices

## 🎮 Core Gameplay

### 🧠 Progressive Difficulty Curve
- **Level 1-10**: Basic arithmetic (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division)
- **Level 10-25**: Algebra, fractions, and basic geometry
- **Level 25-50**: Advanced algebra, sequences, probability
- **Level 50-100**: Calculus, complex word problems, JEE-level challenges
- **Level 100+**: Research-level puzzles and Harvard-style problems
